# Networking

I recently completed a Raspberry Pi project where I learned the basics of networking. 
At the end of the project I had a newly set-up WAP running off of my Raspberry pi. I 
learned concepts like IP Protocols(IPv4, IPv6), what a DHCP is, TCP/IP concepts, and 
more. Interestingly, I really enjoyed the experience which resulted in deciding to go
further and learn more. This repository will be a collection of Java programs written 
for network programming where I'll send notes, new things I've learned, programs for 
future study and reference, as well as attempting to write some network programs of my
own.
